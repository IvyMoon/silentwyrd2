            The night was dark, and the aroma of moon lilies and roses
            filled the air. The sweet smell bothered Ralph, a particularly irksome garden
            gnome.<br>
            "Heck," Ralph muttered.<br>
            Shuffling his feet about, he muttered incoherently.<br>
            Next the fidgeting began. He twiddled his thumbs ignominiously.<br>
            Not able to withstand the flowery fragrance any longer, he began running due East.
            Too bad that was exactly where a field of poppies was.<br>
            He fainted at the sight.<br>
            Ralph the Garden Gnome hates flowers.

          "The moon was luminescent, the sky was starry, and Humphrey was hungry.<br><br>
          Scampering across the luscious grass this fine evening, Humphrey let out a cry of agitation.
          Where was a garbage can?<br><br>
          Every night, Humphrey made his way to the trash, the epitome of what he considered fine dining.
          Half-eaten hamburgers, remnants of chocolate donuts, leftover noodles, and his all-time-favorite
          food, chicken.<br><br>
          This evening, Humphrey had arrived at his normal time (exactly 10:02 pm) at the residence of Mr. Ricardo.<br>
          But alas! Mr. Ricardo's trash can was missing.<br>
          Humphrey suspected his brother, Bob, had stolen it in retaliation for eating the delectable McDonald's
          hamburger they found earlier that week in Mr. Ricardo's trash. While Bob wasn't looking, Humphrey
          had stuffed the entire hamburger into his mouth with his paws.<br><br>
          When Bob asked what happened to the hamburger, Humphrey said it magically floated away into the second
          dimension of the universe. Bob raised his furry eyebrow at the proclamation but said nothing. He didn't
          buy it one bit.<br><br>

          A star twinkles in the midnight sky.<br>
          Flickering dimly then brightly again.<br>
          Continuous in its scintillating glimmers.<br><br>

          An ambiguous blob named Bob looks up into the night.<br>
          He watches the star,<br>
          He wishes upon the star,<br>
          He sticks his tongue out at the star when his wish doesn't come true.<br><br>

          "Bumbling blob," grumbles the star. "Disciplinary action needs to be taken."<br>
          The star calls upon the space-time continuum to punish Bob the blob.<br><br>

          Bob's existence is now a contradiction.<br>
          He feels unsure of it all.<br><br>

          The star is now satisfied.<br>
          Bob is less of a fool and more of a perplexed pea brain.<br>
          Bewildered by the unknowable.<br>
          The star commands the universe to pull back,<br>

            No, I have not. You are quite the bothersome frog, Willard. Shall I call security and have you thrown out
            the window like the pest you know you are?<br><br>
            No, sir. If I'm thrown out the window, I can't fly like you. You're a crane and I'm a frog.

            An evergreen leaf is attached to a tree.<br>
            It has been there since the spring,<br>
            Blowing in the wind,<br>
            And shivering in the cold night's air.<br>
            Winter is coming.<br>
            It knows that Winter is cold.<br>
            But more than that, it sees Winter's intent.<br>
            Winter doesn't just freeze things.<br>
            Winter consumes any warmth it can find,<br>
            Enveloping all the good in its icy embrace <br>
            And freezing away its hope.<br>
            So that all that's left is a deep pit of cold <br>
            Nothingness.<br>
            The evergreen leaf knows that Winter will consume it.<br>
            The evergreen leaf is awaiting its arrival with dread.

            Far, far away,<br>
            Where the moon is magically crescent,<br>
            And the fields are always fertile,<br>
            A singular cow lives.<br>
            Though we know not his name,<br>
            We know his lonesome call.<br>
            "Moooooon," he cries out to the world...<br>
            Behold this poor, lonesome, singular cow,<br>
            Destined to moo at the moon.<br>
            Yes, dear friends, Luna hears his call.<br>
            But space and time envelop her in silence.<br>
            Leaving Luna mute.<br>
            And so, the cow's despairing cry goes unanswered.<br>
            Echoed across rolling plains,<br>
            Reverberating through distant canyons,<br>
            Dissipating into air.<br>

            A star twinkles in the midnight sky.<br>
            Flickering dimly then brightly again.<br>
            Continuous in its scintillating glimmers.<br><br>

            An ambiguous blob named Bob looks up into the night.<br>
            He watches the star,<br>
            He wishes upon the star,<br>
            He sticks his tongue out at the star when his wish doesn't come true.<br><br>

            "He mocked me once, that dunce," the star thinks to himself.<br>
            "Ignorant blob."<br><br>

            Bob finds great delight in sticking his tongue out at the star.<br>
            But the star grows annoyed and eventually offended.<br>
            "Bumbling blob," grumbles the star. "Disciplinary action needs to be taken."<br>
            The star calls upon the space-time continuum to punish Bob the blob.<br><br>

            Bob still looks at the sky with his tongue pointed outward and upward.<br>
            Suddenly!<br>
            The obsidian sky closes in on him,<br>
            And his eyeballs soak in the depth of the night.<br>
            The night melds into his pupils,<br>
            And the black hues merge into one inscrutable darkness.<br>
            The pitch-black profundity of the universe now lives inside of Bob.<br><br>

            Unable to move, Bob feels the universe take over.<br>
            It becomes one with his soul, his energy, and his molecules.<br>
            He is no longer Bob the blob.<br>
            No, instead he feels himself to be all that ever was...<br>
            And the hope of all that could be...<br>
            Beyond the scope of reason and intelligible nature.<br><br>

            Bob knows nothing, yet understands everything.<br>
            And the depth of the infinite universe is contained within him.<br>
            Bob's existence is now a contradiction.<br>
            He feels unsure of it all.<br><br>

            The star is now satisfied.<br>
            Bob is less of a fool and more of a perplexed pea brain.<br>
            Bewildered by the unknowable.<br>
            The star commands the universe to pull back,<br>
            And leave a tiny essence of itself within Bob,<br>
            Such that only the twinkle of the star is left in Bob's eyes.<br>
            And that is that.

            "The night was dark, and the aroma of moon lilies and roses
            filled the air. The sweet smell bothered Ralph, a particularly irksome garden gnome.<br><br>
            'Heck,' Ralph muttered.<br><br>
            Shuffling his feet about, he muttered incoherently.<br><br>
            Next the fidgeting began. He twiddled his thumbs ignominiously.<br><br>
            Not able to withstand the flowery fragrance any longer, he began running due East.<br>
            Too bad that was exactly where a field of poppies was.<br><br>
            He fainted at the sight.<br><br>
            Ralph the Garden Gnome hates flowers."
