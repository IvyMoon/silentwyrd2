        <p>
          The air was frigid, as was the chimney sweep's heart. Standing atop
          mansions, cleaning the nobility's chimneys was cumbersome work.
          Especially during the winter. His clothes were always soiled, smeared
          with black soot. His face, normally pale as snow, took on the ashen hue
          of someone who had already lost everything.<br><br>

          He guessed he had. Standing this particular morning, on the Grand Duke's
          chimney, he felt weary. The sun had not yet risen, and the air was cold.
          This was his favorite time of day. Nobody else was awake, giving him time
          to look up at the sky as dawn approached. He could see a faint glimmer of
          stars, fading as the sun slowly started to rise.<br><br>

          And then he thought of her. The only girl his heart would ever beat for.
          The one girl that he had always dreamed of being with. As far away from
          his reach as the moon. They had never spoken, except for an occasional
          hello when passing. She was the Grand Duke's daughter. As unapproachable
          as girls ever come. But when their eyes met, he knew that there was some
          deep connection between them. Like two ancient souls recognizing their
          shared past way back in time. He had never felt like this around any other
          girl, and it warmed his heart remembering their shared glances.<br><br>

          But alas, his heart was full of sorrow. Standing atop the chimney this
          frigid morning, covered in ash and soot, he started remembering what he
          wished he would not. Closing his eyes, he saw the girl before him. Her
          soulful blue eyes, long pale blond hair, and skin that smelled of moon
          lilies, intoxicating him with her very presence. He smiled sadly at the
          thought of her, and a tear slid slowly down his cheek.<br><br>

          Opening his eyes, more tears began to fall. Dawn was about to
          break. As he looked out over the horizon, he tried holding back quiet
          sobs. She was gone. And the memory of her imprisoned him in an endless
          pool of despair. A horse carriage accident had transported her from this
          life to the next. There would be no more tomorrows for her, and he was
          saddened by the thought of a future that could have been but never will
          be. Standing above everyone and everything on the chimney, he looked up
          at the sky and felt like he was one step closer to reaching her. Perhaps
          she was watching him from above. Suddenly, the sun peeked over the
          skyline, and a sliver of hope slid into his heart. Still consumed by
          grief, his heart was as still as the icy morning air. But the hint of
          sunshine granted him momentary reprieve from his gloom, reminding him of
          his dearly departed's radiance and love of all things light.
          And so, looking at the sunrise, he knew he would see her again someday.
          They were soulmates after all.

        <p>Thunder grumbled in the distance, its angry echoes reverberating over the
        mountaintop and into the nearby valley. The forest below awoke from its
        slumber at the sound. A shiver rolled through the trees, sending silent
        whispers with the wind as leaves rustled about. It was 8:30 PM, and the
        night was darker than usual. Much darker. Blackness cloaked everything,
        pervaded everything, was everything. The moon was nowhere to be seen,
        its luminescence hidden by stormy clouds.<br ><br >
        Thunder rumbled again, this time louder. Its doomful sound became one
        with the night, inspiring fear in everything around. The katydids&#39;
        incessant buzzing stopped abruptly. The barn owls took shelter under
        their wings. All was quiet except for the murmur of the trees. Something
        ominous was here, a baleful sense of fate perhaps, just waiting for the
        right soul to wander in and meet its demise...(<a href="Strange_Attraction.html">read more</a>)</p>

        <p>The marshmallow climbed out of his bag, turning the air around him sweet and delightful.<br>
        "Oh my!" He exclaimed. "I must be brave in this new world."<br><br>
        And so, he began exploring the kitchen. Strolling past a bag of little
        chocolate chips, he gasped with surprise.<br>
        "My, oh my," he thought. "Those poor little succulents, stuck in there..."<br>
        Suddenly, a thought occurred to him! He shivered with a thrill of anticipation.
        Unable to contain his excitement, he began wiggling all his parts and started doing jumping-jacks.<br>
        "My, oh my, what an excellent idea," he thought to himself.<br><br>
        And so, without further ado, he released the chocolate chips.<br>
        Down and down they poured, out of the bag and all over the countertop,
        their squeals of joy high-pitched and annoying.<br><br>

        The marshmallow smiled and applauded himself for this act of justice.
        Keeping food locked up in bags was foul, the epitome of injustice.<br>
        Who would do such a thing?...

         <p>The orange pumpkin laughed degradingly at himself.<br><br>
           It was early evening on Halloween night, and he sat all alone on a brick doorstep,
           watching the clouds roll by with their hues of ominous gray. The wind was chilly,
           and he shivered at the thought of the horrible wrong that'd been done to him. The
           knowledge was painful, but the experience had been far worse. And he had scars to prove it.<br><br>
           "Bah humbug," he said. His words were crisp on the frigid air.<br><br>
           He liked how it sounded&#8212;talking out loud to himself. He continued on.<br><br>

          <p>Thunder grumbled in the distance, its angry echoes reverberating over the
          mountaintop and into the nearby valley. The forest below awoke from its
          slumber at the sound. A shiver rolled through the trees, sending silent
          whispers with the wind as leaves rustled about. It was 8:30 PM, and the
          night was darker than usual. Much darker. Blackness cloaked everything,
          pervaded everything, was everything. The moon was nowhere to be seen,
          its luminescence hidden by stormy clouds.<br ><br >
          Thunder rumbled again, this time louder. Its doomful sound became one
          with the night, inspiring fear in everything around. The katydids&#39;
          incessant buzzing stopped abruptly. The barn owls took shelter under
          their wings. All was quiet except for the murmur of the trees. Something
          ominous was here, a baleful sense of fate perhaps, just waiting for the
          right soul to wander in and meet its demise...(<a href="Strange_Attraction.html">read more</a>)</p>

          <p>The marshmallow climbed out of his bag, turning the air around him sweet and delightful.<br>
          "Oh my!" He exclaimed. "I must be brave in this new world."<br><br>
          And so, he began exploring the kitchen. Strolling past a bag of little
          chocolate chips, he gasped with surprise.<br>
          "My, oh my," he thought. "Those poor little succulents, stuck in there..."<br>
          Suddenly, a thought occurred to him! He shivered with a thrill of anticipation.
          Unable to contain his excitement, he began wiggling all his parts and started doing jumping-jacks.<br>
          "My, oh my, what an excellent idea," he thought to himself.<br><br>
          And so, without further ado, he released the chocolate chips.<br>
          Down and down they poured, out of the bag and all over the countertop,
          their squeals of joy high-pitched and annoying.<br><br>

          The marshmallow smiled and applauded himself for this act of justice.
          Keeping food locked up in bags was foul, the epitome of injustice.<br>
          Who would do such a thing?...
