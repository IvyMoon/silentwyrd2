        <p>
           The orange pumpkin laughed degradingly at himself.<br><br>

           It was early evening on Halloween night, and he sat all alone on a brick doorstep,
           watching the clouds roll by with their hues of ominous gray. The wind was chilly,
           and he shivered at the thought of the horrible wrong that'd been done to him. The
           knowledge was painful, but the experience had been far worse. And he had scars to prove it.<br><br>

           "Bah humbug," he said. His words were crisp on the frigid air.<br><br>

           He liked how it sounded&#8212;talking out loud to himself. He continued on.<br><br>

           ". . . She abducted me from my family . . ."<br><br>

           He thought of his patch and all the pumpkins there: his family. They started out as
           seedlings in the dirt, and he grew up next to Tom, his best friend. They did everything
           together&#8212;counting crows flying by in the sky, watching leaves fall, and spending time in
           the company of all their brothers and sisters. But now it was all over. And sadness enveloped him.<br><br>

           Flashes of a cruel beast bombarded his mind: a little girl, her hands on his stem, the
           searing pain as she ripped him from his vine . . . and the sound of her carefree voice as
           she suggested turning him into a pie.<br><br>

           Oh my, OH MY!<br><br>

           Reliving this nightmare was too much! He hyperventilated in the cool air, but even its chill
           wasn't enough to restrain the excited delirium growing inside him. His head felt hot, and it
           wasn't because of the lighted candle inside him.<br>
           Madness took over, and from that point on he was a simple lunatic.<br><br>

           Laughter poured from his poorly cut mouth. And his voice dripped with perverted insanity.
           "She carved my face . . . she mutilated by body . . . she took my guts out . . ."<br><br>

           A nearby squirrel preparing for her evening meal dropped her hickory nut in shock. What a
           creepy pumpkin, she thought. She surveyed him warily: equilateral eyes, a triangular nose,
           and a sexily lacerated mouth. Nut-almighty! The pumpkin was hot and not just because of the
           candlelight burning within him!<br><br>

           The boisterous pumpkin laughed some more. He reveled in his masochistic ways.<br>
           Giggling, chortling, and raving about the pain a little girl had inflicted upon him.<br><br>

           Soon children came to trick-or-treat dressed as goblins, fairies, crayons, and little devils.
           As each little kid walked up to the doorstep, the pumpkin whispered words of madness.<br><br>

           ". . . fate of the vine . . ." he told the princess.<br>
           His breath on the wind sounded like a ghost, and the little girl shivered with fear.<br><br>

           Next came a zebra, to whom he said, ". . . pie maketh me not . . ."<br>
           The little kid's stomach grumbled with hunger, so she reached into her bag and ate a Twizzlers candy.<br><br>

           When the warlock came, he took special notice of the orange pumpkin. The little boy picked up the
           pumpkin with both hands and smiled evilly. Inspired by video games, he decided to destroy the pumpkin
           and see what magic lay therein.<br><br>

           That insane orange pumpkin had no warning.<br>
           Nor did the ogling squirrel who'd been watching the pumpkin from her perch in the hickory tree.<br><br>

           Down . . . down the pumpkin went, propelled by the warlock's hands and pulled down by gravity.<br><br>

           CRACK!<br><br>

           Orange was everywhere.<br><br>

           Hunks . . . chunks . . . of pumpkin carcass lay on the porch.<br><br>

           The warlock had murdered the orange pumpkin.<br><br>

           Like Humpty Dumpty, the pumpkin could not be put back together again. The squirrel from the tree
           looked on in horror, her heart momentarily broken. But after 3.5 seconds, she decided there were
           plenty of nuts in the world, and it would be easy to fantasize over a new one in the area. Go figure!<br><br>

           Thus ends the story of an insane orange pumpkin and a squirrel's perverted lust.

        <p>Thunder grumbled in the distance, its angry echoes reverberating over the
        mountaintop and into the nearby valley. The forest below awoke from its
        slumber at the sound. A shiver rolled through the trees, sending silent
        whispers with the wind as leaves rustled about. It was 8:30 PM, and the
        night was darker than usual. Much darker. Blackness cloaked everything,
        pervaded everything, was everything. The moon was nowhere to be seen,
        its luminescence hidden by stormy clouds.<br ><br >
        Thunder rumbled again, this time louder. Its doomful sound became one
        with the night, inspiring fear in everything around. The katydids&#39;
        incessant buzzing stopped abruptly. The barn owls took shelter under
        their wings. All was quiet except for the murmur of the trees. Something
        ominous was here, a baleful sense of fate perhaps, just waiting for the
        right soul to wander in and meet its demise...

         <p>The marshmallow climbed out of his bag, turning the air around him sweet and delightful.<br>
         "Oh my!" He exclaimed. "I must be brave in this new world."<br><br>
         And so, he began exploring the kitchen. Strolling past a bag of little
         chocolate chips, he gasped with surprise.<br>
         "My, oh my," he thought. "Those poor little succulents, stuck in there..."<br>
         Suddenly, a thought occurred to him! He shivered with a thrill of anticipation.
         Unable to contain his excitement, he began wiggling all his parts and started doing jumping-jacks.<br>
         "My, oh my, what an excellent idea," he thought to himself.<br><br>
         And so, without further ado, he released the chocolate chips.<br>
         Down and down they poured, out of the bag and all over the countertop,
         their squeals of joy high-pitched and annoying.<br><br>

         The marshmallow smiled and applauded himself for this act of justice.
         Keeping food locked up in bags was foul, the epitome of injustice.<br>
         Who would do such a thing?...

         <p>The air was frigid, as was the chimney sweep's heart. Standing atop
         mansions, cleaning the nobility's chimneys was cumbersome work.
         Especially during the winter. His clothes were always soiled, smeared
         with black soot. His face, normally pale as snow, took on the ashen hue
         of someone who had already lost everything.<br><br>
         He guessed he had. Standing this particular morning, on the Grand Duke's
         chimney, he felt weary. The sun had not yet risen, and the air was cold.
         This was his favorite time of day. Nobody else was awake, giving him time
         to look up at the sky as dawn approached. He could see a faint glimmer of
         stars, fading as the sun slowly started to rise...

          <p>Thunder grumbled in the distance, its angry echoes reverberating over the
          mountaintop and into the nearby valley. The forest below awoke from its
          slumber at the sound. A shiver rolled through the trees, sending silent
          whispers with the wind as leaves rustled about. It was 8:30 PM, and the
          night was darker than usual. Much darker. Blackness cloaked everything,
          pervaded everything, was everything. The moon was nowhere to be seen,
          its luminescence hidden by stormy clouds.<br ><br >
          Thunder rumbled again, this time louder. Its doomful sound became one
          with the night, inspiring fear in everything around. The katydids&#39;
          incessant buzzing stopped abruptly. The barn owls took shelter under
          their wings. All was quiet except for the murmur of the trees. Something
          ominous was here, a baleful sense of fate perhaps, just waiting for the
          right soul to wander in and meet its demise...
