        <p id="smallerTop">
           Thunder grumbled in the distance, its angry echoes reverberating over the
           mountaintop and into the nearby valley. The forest below awoke from its
           slumber at the sound. A shiver rolled through the trees, sending silent
           whispers with the wind as leaves rustled about. It was 8:30 PM, and the
           night was darker than usual. Much darker. Blackness cloaked everything,
           pervaded everything, was everything. The moon was nowhere to be seen,
           its luminescence hidden by stormy clouds.<br ><br >
           Thunder rumbled again, this time louder. Its doomful sound became one
           with the night, inspiring fear in everything around. The katydids&#39;
           incessant buzzing stopped abruptly. The barn owls took shelter under
           their wings. All was quiet except for the murmur of the trees. Something
           ominous was here, a baleful sense of fate perhaps, just waiting for the
           right soul to wander in and meet its demise.<br ><br >
           Nearby, in the local antiquarian bookstore, Vanessa gazed out the window.
           Her midnight green eyes emanated the same gloomy ambiance of the
           evening. She had been crying since noon and left school early to come
           here. The peace she felt among books was paramount to any other place
           she visited. Their timeworn covers seemed to carry the weight of
           thousands of secrets, so she felt they understood her best. More than
           any person could. In her hands, she stroked a copy of Elias Ashmole&#39;s
           <em>Theatrum Chemicum Brittannicum</em>, its pages golden and smooth against her
           skin. She looked down at it, her eyes still red and rimmed with darkness.
           Today had been long, too long. She felt like a shadow of her earlier
           self. Perhaps there was something in this book to make her feel better.
           Something uplifting that a philosophical poet had to say about her
           situation. But . . . probably not. She was ready for the day to end.<br ><br >
           With a heavy sigh, she placed the book back in its place on the shelf and
           turned toward the window again. In it, she saw her reflection. Her fuzzy
           gray cashmere sweater, dark skinny jeans, and sparkly pink flats couldn&#39;t
           hide the sadness in her willowy frame. Her shoulders slouched from the
           sorrow she had carried all day. Tears stained her face, half cloaked by
           long, dark hair that fell in tumultuous twists to her waist. And her
           eyes, supposedly the windows to her soul, were empty now.<br ><br >
           She smiled bleakly at her mirror image. Twirling a strand of hair around
           her finger, her thoughts turned to events from earlier that morning. At
           5:20 AM, she had woken up, changed into her exercising clothes, and went
           running outside. Cool mist refreshed her face as she breezed through the
           dawn. When she came back, she showered, ate breakfast, and drove to high
           school in her 1997 Chevrolet Blazer. She took the long way to school that
           morning, driving alongside the forest that began near her house. It was
           her favorite route because nobody ever went that way, and every time she
           passed it, she felt inexplicably drawn to enter the woods. She imagined
           one day she would but had never gotten around to doing so. Still, its
           allure captivated her, never leaving her subconscious.<br ><br >
           It wasn&#39;t until she arrived at school, however, that her day went awry.
           The first few classes passed by ordinarily: calculus, history, then
           French. Once the clock hit 11:30 AM, she headed over to the cafeteria.
           She spotted her boyfriend Julius sitting in their usual corner of the
           lunchroom, so she went ahead and got her food. As she made her way over
           to him, she noticed a girl with raven hair sitting next to him &#8212; her best
           friend Lisa.<br ><br >
           How nice, she thought. Maybe they were finally starting to tolerate one
           another. She remembered when she first introduced her best friend to
           Julius. They seemed to take an immediate dislike to each other, animosity
           simmering within their gazes. Whenever they talked, it was like a
           competition to see who could antagonize the other the most. Their only
           commonality seemed to be her. So it came as a shock to see them at ease
           around each other today. She smiled as she approached, quite glad to see
           the transformation.<br ><br >
           That is, until he lifted his arm and draped it around Lisa&#39;s shoulder.
           In response, Lisa tilted her head back into the nook of his arm and
           looked longingly up at him. His walnut brown eyes seductively lowered to
           hers, and before Vanessa could process what was happening, Julius had
           planted a kiss on Lisa&#39;s mouth.<br ><br >
           Shock could not begin to describe how Vanessa felt. First she was
           surprised, then rage filled her heart &#8212; the betrayal was too painful for
           her to bear. She dropped the apple she was holding, desolation
           overpowering her. She watched them as their kiss deepened, too
           traumatized to move a muscle. It was like the ground had reached up,
           taken ahold of her, and rooted her to the spot. As a tear began to roll
           down her cheek, she somehow managed to find the strength to turn away.
           She didn&#39;t want them to see her. Those traitors.<br ><br >
           She swiftly walked herself out of the lunchroom, her glittering pink
           flats carrying her quietly. As she moved down the hall, memories with
           Lisa flashed into her mind &#8212; those carefree times now painful to
           remember. She passed by her old locker, thinking of when they stood there
           just to watch the cute basketball players pass by at 9:03 AM every
           morning. Lisa always swooned over this one guy, Michael, because he had
           extremely big muscles. More than once she vividly described how she
           imagined him wrapping his arms around her, enveloping her in his
           manliness, and . . . yeah, Lisa had a wild imagination.<br ><br >
           More tears streamed down her face as she thought of Lisa. How could she
           do this to her? She was supposed to be her best friend, not a
           boyfriend-thief. And Julius. Her heart quivered at the thought of him.
           His dark quizzical eyebrows, magnetizing eyes, and slanted smile all
           seemed like a lie, an illusion meant to sweep every girl off her feet.
           Every memory she had of him now was painful. It was like nails had been
           jammed into her once radiant heart, and as the sunshine bled out, a dull
           nothingness was left in its place. She recalled when Julius first told
           her he liked her. She was making a salad at the salad bar and had just
           reached for the tomatoes when this handsome guy started talking to her
           out of the blue. Leaning against the counter, he seemed cool and
           laid-back when he asked her out. She turned ecstatic, the tomatoes
           rolling off her plate and onto the floor. He smirked in what she thought
           was an endearing smile. Now she realized it was apathetic and that she
           was hardly anything special to him &#8212; just another girl to pass by the
           time. That much was proven when he moved onto Lisa. She found it bitterly
           comical that the lunchroom was the place where he had stirred up a sense
           of love in her heart and then crushed it by kissing her best friend
           there.<br ><br >
           Overwhelmed with heartache, Vanessa walked out the door to the parking
           lot, got in her trustworthy car, and drove to the only place she felt
           real peace &#8212; the antiquarian bookstore she was currently at. Still
           staring out the window, she returned from her memories and noticed the
           darkness outside. Its endless depth consumed the night, and she felt its
           presence within her, so much as though it might seep through the
           windowsill and join with the gloom already inside her. She shuddered at
           the thought, thunder delighting at her unease and joining with quakes of
           its own.<br ><br >
           Moving her glittery feet, she descended the upper level&#39;s steps. No one
           had heard her sobbing up there, which made it the perfect place to cry
           her heart out. She bid goodbye to Elmo, the elderly bookkeeper who was
           almost as ancient as the books he sold. He looked up from a copy of
           <em>Evelina</em>, a peculiar choice for such an old man, and gave her a
           toothless smile. He was a sweet old man, that Elmo.<br ><br >
           She pushed open the door and stepped outside. A gust of wind blew tiny
           water droplets against her, and thunder boomed. The storm was closer than
           she thought. And the wind promised with its misty undercurrents a violent
           rainstorm. She walked hurriedly to her car, hoping to make it home before
           the rain came pouring down. Inside, she stuck the key in the ignition and
           turned . . . nothing happened. She tried again but in vain. Her motor would
           not start; it was completely devoid of life. Frustrated, she tucked her
           hair behind her ears and huffed out a sigh. What was she supposed to do
           now?<br ><br >
           Sitting in the silent car, Vanessa&#39;s dark feelings came rushing back at
           her. She could not stand the silence festering her heartbreak; it only
           made her feel worse. After a few moments, she got out of the car and
           stared up at the endless black sky. A raindrop plopped down on her
           forehead, followed by several more on the car&#39;s windshield. The rain had
           begun. Its pitter-patter on the concrete parking lot created a peaceful
           melody, the sound swathing her in a momentary cocoon of tranquility. Her
           mind at ease, she began to think.<br ><br >
           She looked to her right and saw the forest. If she walked through it, she
           might be able to reach her house before the storm got too bad. Nobody was
           going to help her on a night like this, so she figured she might as well
           leave now. Grabbing her backpack from the passenger side seat, she
           dredged off toward the forest. Fixing her car would have to wait until
           tomorrow.<br ><br >
           The closer Vanessa got to the edge of the forest, the more menacing it
           appeared. The night was clad in blackness, yet an inexplicable mist could
           be seen at the forest&#39;s threshold. Shades of boysenberry and obsidian
           slowly twirled together, suggesting danger awaited within. She stopped
           and stared at it, thinking how pretty those colors would have been on her
           prom dress. Prom . . . Julius . . . A night that will never be . . . Her
           eyes darkened at the thought of seeing him again. That backstabbing,
           two-timing, ungrateful piece of a squirrel&#39;s uncracked hickory nut.<br ><br >
           Anger overtook her, and she marched full-force into the forest. Never
           mind the noxious mist, never mind Julius, never mind anything anymore.
           Nothing mattered, nothing except the anger fueling her heart. Stomping
           through the darkness, she glared furiously at things she couldn&#39;t see.
           The night creatures shied away from her, sensing her uncontrolled anger.
           And the darkness of the forest, as if attracted to Vanessa&#39;s somber mood,
           followed silently behind her. She felt horrible inside, the rage and
           heartbreak eating her alive. She wished it would all just go away. Taking
           an agonized breath, she held it in while holding back a sob rising from
           her throat. Her eyes began to water, and her lips pressed together
           involuntarily. Surrendering herself to the darkness, she finally breathed
           out a broken sigh. Twigs broke under her feet as she walked, and she
           became preoccupied listening to the sound.<br ><br >
           She walked for a long time that way, listening to twigs breaking, rain
           falling, and thunder bellowing. And as the night wore on, her anger waned
           out. Exhaustion took its place, causing her feet to drag and stumble over
           rocks. Eventually, she tripped over a fallen log, landing face-first on
           the boggy earth. Muttering incoherently, she picked herself up and came
           to her senses.<br ><br >
           Her senses told her she was lost. Very lost. Looking around, she vaguely
           made out the outlines of the trees beside her. The ebony essence of the
           night ensnared everything. How was she supposed to find her way back now?
           Everything looked the same in this forest. Plus, she was the kind of
           person that went the wrong way even with a compass and map. Ever since
           she was little, the art of navigation had been a lost cause for her, and
           tonight was no exception!<br ><br >
           Vanessa&#39;s dark eyebrows scrunched together as she thought about what to
           do next. She was tired, and her thoughts were muddled. She couldn&#39;t think
           straight. Her mind was playing tricks on her; in the corner of her eye
           she saw the eerie purple-black mist from earlier. Perplexing images
           flashed through her mind: alluring golden eyes, the English novel
           <em>Evelina</em>, warped tree branches, and finally an angry squirrel
           yelling. Each image brought with it a flurry of emotions, infusing her
           with sadness, confusion, surprise, and irritation. Feeling distraught,
           she picked a direction and just started walking. She had to get out of
           this forest and away from the lunacy of it all.<br ><br >
           A few minutes later, Vanessa stopped walking. There was no point in
           continuing on. She was tired and forlorn. The rain ceaselessly fell, and
           its ubiquitous flow invited her to plunge to the ground with it. Taking
           its cue, she gave up. Her knees buckled underneath her, and she crumpled
           to the ground quietly. She was dead inside, and lost in some stupid
           forest. She cursed herself silently for being the idiot she knew she was.
           Curling into a ball, she hugged her knees and began to cry once more.
           <br ><br >
           Suddenly, leaves crunched to her left. The sound startled her, and she
           looked for it. Her heart skipped a beat. Two umber brown boots faced her,
           unmoving on this dreary night. As her eyes traveled upwards, she noticed
           pantaloons draped effortlessly over this stranger&#39;s boots. His long, dark
           claret overcoat complemented the ebony shirt he wore underneath. She
           noticed a tawny, golden pocket watch hanging languidly outside his pants
           pocket. Leaves were engraved around a single diamond, tastefully
           expressive of his wealth. His entire outfit appeared to have been
           tailored for him.<br ><br >
           Vanessa noticed his clenched jaw; he seemed uneasy about something.
           Shifting his weight uncertainly, he tilted his head and studied her. His
           fixated eyes caused her to wriggle with nervousness. What was this guy
           doing here on this stormy night? He just stood there silently, surveying
           her on the ground.<br ><br >
           Unraveling herself, Vanessa put her hands on the earth beside her and
           slid back, hoping to get a better look at the stranger. Wet dirt clung to
           her gray cashmere sweater as she did so, hoping to add her to its
           collection of forest flora. She certainly felt like one at this point,
           drenched and dirty, like the girl from <em>The Ring</em>.<br ><br >
           His shadowed face, though tense, was striking. He had disheveled, walnut
           red-brown hair that swooped over his forehead into his eyes and covered
           his ears. He looked like he had been walking through the rain for a
           while. His amber eyes, framed by long eyelashes, glistened with a golden
           undertone. It was like the luminescence of the hidden moon was trapped
           there. And a masculine jaw matched his princely physique. He was the
           epitome of old-world elegance. She was attracted to him &#8212; very attracted.
           <br ><br >
           Her breath hitched when their eyes met. His gaze locked in on hers, and
           her breathing stopped for a moment. Everything around her went away: the
           night, the forest, and the rain. Golden eyes captivated hers, inviting
           her to fall into their warmth. Her heart fluttered at the thought.
           Exhaling, her lips parted and her heart instinctively sped up. Her grief
           dissolved into the murky forest around her.<br ><br >
           For a moment, they simply stayed like that, staring at each other. She
           could feel the intensity of his gaze penetrating the night with an
           other-worldly energy. It both excited and unnerved her. Suddenly, his
           dark frame shifted and he took a few steps toward her. Reaching out his
           left hand, he offered it to her. Confused and frightened by the gesture,
           she backed away.<br ><br >
           &#34;Please,&#34; he said gently, as though taming a wild animal. &#34;Fear me not. I
           only mean to help you.&#34;<br ><br >
           She must have had a wild look in her eyes because he pursed his lips and
           backed away a step. She sat there, still dumfounded that this perfect
           stranger was talking to her.<br ><br >
           He tried saying something again, his voice now strangely husky.<br ><br >
           &#34; . . . Miss, if you please. Take my hand and let me help you up. A storm is
           afoot and sitting here alone is dangerous.&#34;<br ><br >
           He held his hand out again, expectantly. Vanessa looked at it. Biting her
           inner lip, she twisted her mouth in a half-grimace, half-smile. She
           didn&#39;t know what to make of this stranger but had a funny feeling growing
           inside her. It was getting stronger by the second, and she wanted it to
           stop.<br ><br >
           Lifting her arm, she reached for his hand. The moment their fingers
           touched, she felt an electric shock hum through her body. His essence
           seeped into her, and she felt everything he was. She could feel sunshine
           flowing into her, filling the empty recesses of her heart. It reached the
           depths of her soul, and she wanted more &#8212; so much more.<br ><br >
           Before she knew it, she was on her feet and pressed against his chest.
           His arms encased her, and she felt radiance blossom through her chest.
           What was happening? And how had she gotten so close to him? She looked up
           demurely at this young man. His amber eyes were trained on hers, but his
           look was far away. Like he was lost in some wondrous feeling of euphoria.
           <br ><br >
           What happened next felt surreal. His soul sensuously snaked around
           Vanessa&#39;s body, drifting across her skin and melding with her being. She
           reveled in the ecstasy of its tender touch. His soul gently probed the
           outer reaches of hers as it floated by. Finding no entrance, it firmly yet
           gently demanded its way in. His light propelled it forward, pushing it to
           adjoin with hers. Their souls touched, and she was blissfully relieved of
           her sadness. She gasped with pleasure as his soul entwined around hers.
           He gently moaned in response. The gratification of their bond had
           awakened their carnal desire for each other.<br ><br >
           Shuddering with delight at the intensity of their connection, Vanessa
           closed her eyes and breathed out a happy sigh. Then she stepped back,
           severing the moment. Warm peace washed away as the hours of night
           surrounded her. The forest was once again her somber prison.<br ><br >
           The handsome stranger snapped out of his reverie. Those swoon-worthy,
           golden eyes of his darkened under furrowed eyebrows. He seemed upset by
           the disconnection. She couldn&#39;t blame him; the experience had been
           transcendental. Noticing her watchful eye, the young man relaxed, wiping
           the emotion from his face.<br ><br >
           Uncomfortable silence ensued. Vanessa started to speak, her voice raspy
           from the all the crying she had done.<br ><br >
           &#34;. . . Wha-who are you?&#34; she asked quietly, stumbling over her words.<br ><br >
           &#34;An enigma, my dear,&#34; he said laughingly, a spirited twinkle in his eye.
           &#34;If my name is what you wish to know, it&#39;s Felix &#8212; Felix DuBois. And who
           are you, if I may ask?&#34;<br ><br >
           Bewilderment obscured Vanessa&#39;s mind. What did he mean by enigma? And who
           talks like that anyway? He spoke like a gentleman from the past, which
           was weird &#8212; but terribly attractive too. His charming tongue only made
           her like him more.<br ><br >
           &#34;Vanessa Claremont,&#34; she answered. There was no point in being untruthful
           with him. This guy &#8212; Felix &#8212; he seemed trustworthy. She felt that when
           they connected. His soul seemed pure, the knight in shining armor type.
           She could totally imagine him saving some damsel-in-distress. Tonight,
           she was that damsel. And who better to save her from this dark forest
           than him?<br ><br >
           &#34;A lovely name for a lovely lady. I am pleased to make your acquaintance,
           Vanessa. Now, I really must insist you leave this forest immediately.
           Danger lurks within and can sense your aliveness.&#34;<br ><br >
           Felix&#39;s words only added to her confusion. He talked about the forest as
           though it were conscious, aware of everything going on inside it.<br ><br >
           &#34;Aliveness?&#34; she stammered.<br ><br >
           Amusement flashed across his face. She didn&#39;t know why.<br ><br >
           &#34;The state of being alive,&#34; he said slowly, emphasizing each word as
           though she was hard of hearing. He looked at her more fully now, and his
           eyes softened when he saw what a wreck she was. Vanessa&#39;s mascara-smudged
           eyes, tear-stained face, and muddy clothes revealed her broken emotional
           state. Concerned condemnation filled his voice.<br ><br >
           &#34;I&#39;m not sure what prompted you to enter this forest, Vanessa, but you
           must leave now.&#34;<br ><br >
           The seriousness of his words made her tremble.<br ><br >
           &#34;Is there danger here?&#34; Even as she asked, she could feel the sinister
           presence of the forest nearby. It seemed to stay back though, as if
           afraid to come near. She suspected it had something to do with Felix and
           his spectral sunshine.<br ><br >
           &#34;Yes, there certainly is. Have you seen the virulent mist? It is purple
           and black and moves about ominously throughout this forest. A wicked
           presence lives inside of it and may materialize whenever it chooses.&#34;
           <br ><br >
           Just then, she heard the boom of thunder, followed by the faint chuckle
           of a squirrel, its evil laugh emanating from the mist. The sound unnerved
           her. Suddenly aware of the darkness and the complexity of its depth,
           Vanessa shivered with a twinge of fear. She stepped closer to Felix. She
           felt safer in his presence.<br ><br >
           &#34;I&#39;m not sure how to get home,&#34; she admitted. &#34;Can you help me find my
           way?&#34; She pointed in the direction she thought her house was in.<br ><br >
           Indescribable intensity filled his eyes as he looked at her. She did not
           understand it. Then it went away as quickly as it had come. Taking her
           hand, he expertly looped it through his arm and began to guide her in the
           direction she pointed.<br ><br >
           Rain drizzled from the sky as they sauntered through the forest. She
           could hear individual raindrops echo lightly on the leaves above her,
           solemnly ending their journeys from the sky. Those lovely little echoes
           reminded her of the sadness she felt before. It dampened her mood for a
           moment, but then she gazed at her arm linked with Felix&#39;s. It brought her
           comfort. A faint smile graced her lips as she realized she felt better.
           <br ><br >
           Soon they reached the edge of the forest, ready to leave the perpetual
           darkness behind. Or so she thought. She saw a warm light glowing from her
           house and turned to Felix to thank him for his help, maybe even invite
           him inside. Her mother would love to hear about how he rescued her.<br ><br >
           But as she turned to face him, he was gone. Bewilderment turned to panic
           as she glanced around but found no trace of him. She did notice, however,
           the sinister mist from before. Traces of boysenberry glimmered in its
           midnight tones. She watched silently as it receded behind her into the
           darkness. Its tendrils swirled at her, malevolently waving goodbye. Just
           before it completely vanished, she heard Felix&#39;s whisper in the wind.
           <br ><br >
           &#34;Vanessa. . .&#34; his voice sighed, full of a yearning she felt within herself.
           <br ><br >
           And then the mist was gone.

         <p>The marshmallow climbed out of his bag, turning the air around him sweet and delightful.<br>
         "Oh my!" He exclaimed. "I must be brave in this new world."<br><br>
         And so, he began exploring the kitchen. Strolling past a bag of little
         chocolate chips, he gasped with surprise.<br>
         "My, oh my," he thought. "Those poor little succulents, stuck in there..."<br>
         Suddenly, a thought occurred to him! He shivered with a thrill of anticipation.
         Unable to contain his excitement, he began wiggling all his parts and started doing jumping-jacks.<br>
         "My, oh my, what an excellent idea," he thought to himself.<br><br>
         And so, without further ado, he released the chocolate chips.<br>
         Down and down they poured, out of the bag and all over the countertop,
         their squeals of joy high-pitched and annoying.<br><br>

         The marshmallow smiled and applauded himself for this act of justice.
         Keeping food locked up in bags was foul, the epitome of injustice.<br>
         Who would do such a thing?...

         <a href="The_Chimney_Sweep.html"><span>The Chimney Sweep</span></a><br>
         <p>The air was frigid, as was the chimney sweep's heart. Standing atop
         mansions, cleaning the nobility's chimneys was cumbersome work.

         <p>The orange pumpkin laughed degradingly at himself.<br><br>
           It was early evening on Halloween night, and he sat all alone on a brick doorstep,
           watching the clouds roll by with their hues of ominous gray. The wind was chilly,
           and he shivered at the thought of the horrible wrong that'd been done to him. The
           knowledge was painful, but the experience had been far worse. And he had scars to prove it.<br><br>
           "Bah humbug," he said. His words were crisp on the frigid air.<br><br>

           <p>The marshmallow climbed out of his bag, turning the air around him sweet and delightful.<br>
           "Oh my!" He exclaimed. "I must be brave in this new world."<br><br>
           And so, he began exploring the kitchen. Strolling past a bag of little
           chocolate chips, he gasped with surprise.<br>
           "My, oh my," he thought. "Those poor little succulents, stuck in there..."<br>
           Suddenly, a thought occurred to him! He shivered with a thrill of anticipation.
           Unable to contain his excitement, he began wiggling all his parts and started doing jumping-jacks.<br>
           "My, oh my, what an excellent idea," he thought to himself.<br><br>
           And so, without further ado, he released the chocolate chips.<br>
           Down and down they poured, out of the bag and all over the countertop,
           their squeals of joy high-pitched and annoying.<br><br>

           The marshmallow smiled and applauded himself for this act of justice.
           Keeping food locked up in bags was foul, the epitome of injustice.<br>
